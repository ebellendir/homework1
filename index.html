      <h4><b>About me</b></h4>
      <p>
        Eric studied at the University of Illinois, where he majored in Economics and minored in both mathematics and business. During his freshman year of college, Eric had his first taste of entreprenuership by becoming a Branch Manager for College Works Painting. Eric successfully cold-called, sold, and produced exterior paint projects in River Forest and Oak Park, IL. For the most part, Eric hired his friends to complete the painting. At the end of the summer, Eric sold and produced over $40,000 in exterior paint projects.

        After Eric graduated from University of Illinois, he started his first job post college with National City Bank in a development program. Shortly after Eric joined National City Bank, National City Bank was purchased by PNC Bank due to the financial crisis. At PNC Eric transitioned into PNC's Investment department. Eric participated in a one year development program with PNC Investments and landed a job as a Financial Advisor for PNC. At the time, Eric was the youngest Financial Advisor in the state of Illinois for PNC.

        Eric wanted to explore other areas of banking so he left PNC Investments to go into commercial banking. Eric joined First Midwest Bank in their commercial banking department because of the variety of deals he would be able to underwrite. After working for FMB for two years, Eric developed a niche in specialty finance. Eric is now an Associate at BMO Harris Bank in their Financial Institutions Group. The Financial Institutions Group underwrites loans to investment dealers, exchanges, and specialty finance companies
